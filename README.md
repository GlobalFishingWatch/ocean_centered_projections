# Ocean Centered Projections

A collection of Ocean centered projections we are experimenting with.

# TODO: add distortion plots for all three projections

## Data

You can download some sample data from Global Fishing Watch following the 
steps shown in [notebooks/data/Download.ipynb](notebooks/data/Download.ipynb).
This data will produce plots that are similar, but not identical to those
shown below.

## Projections

### Spilhaus-Adams

    TODO: Provide some links to discussion of history

The main disadvantage of the Spilhaus-Adams projection is that it has
quite large distortion relative to Elastic projections. Most
noticeably, near the coast of China where it greatly inflates the
already large vessel presence there. 

An example of plotting with the Spilhaus projection is located in this
[repo](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/spilhaus). It is not
included here because the I didn't want to mix licenses.

### Elastic Projections

The [Elastic projections]
(https://kunimune.blog/2023/12/29/introducing-the-elastic-projections/)
are a family of map projections developed by Justin Kunimune. These
projections include one meant for mapping the oceans (`Elastic-II`) and
more importantly their [repo](https://github.com/jkunimune/elastik) 
includes with a toolkit for creating new projections by specifying where
to cut the globe and how to weight different regions when attempting to
minimize distortion.

If you want overlays on the Elastic plots described below you'll need to
download shapefiles from [Natural Earth] (https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/) 
and place them to the `resources/shapefiles/natural_earth` directory.
You'll need:
    * Rivers: `ne_50m_rivers_lake_centerlines_scale_rank.zip`
    * Lakes: `ne_110m_lakes.zip`
    * Shoreline: `ne_50m_coastline.zip`

See the [PlotElastic notebook](notebooks/elastic/PlotElastic.ipynb) for
some examples of how to plot data in Elastic projections.

#### Elastic-II

The Elastic-II projection greatly improves on the distortion present in
the Spilhaus-Adams projection, but at the cost of Australia. Australia
is disintegratedâ€“cut nearly in half and then smeared along the edge of
the projection so as to be unrecognizable. In practice, people tend to
find this confusing.

#### Elastic-X (aka Ozone?)
